##Cryptography Algorithms

Implementation of various cryptography algorithms (Caesar cipher, Rot-13, one-time pad, Playfair, Hill, DES, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Feistel, Railfence) and key generation techniques (Diffie-Hellman, Linear Congruential, Blum Blum Shub) in C and C++. The system reads inputs from a text file and generates encrypted and decrypted outputs in a text file.
